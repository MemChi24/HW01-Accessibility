# HW01-Horiseon-Streamlining-Accessibility
Updating Sites Accessibility Requirements

## Description
I streamlined existing code to help make Horiseon's site more accessible for Search Engine Optimization.

## Action Steps
- First I viewed the source code to find semantic elements.
- Then I replaced exisitng div elements with appropriate semantic elements throughout the code.
- Then I viewed the structue of the HTML elements to insure they follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
- Then I viewed image elements and added alt attributes.
- Then I made sure the heading attributes fell in sequential order.
- Then I gave the Title element a concise and descriptive TITLE.
- Then I consolidated and organized sections of the CSS.
- Then I commented throughout the CSS where appropriate.
- Then I completed my README file.
- Then I made sure my Repository was in good shape and contained necessary files and appropriate names.
